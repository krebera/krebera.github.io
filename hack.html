<h3 class="tag-blurb">I was 13 when my parents got me an Arduino for Christmas. I entered college planning to study medicine, and now I'm a Computer Engineer. There's something very satisfying about the physicality of wires and electricity, microcontrollers and FPGA's. In embedded systems, I found the physical analog to my game-programming itch. Always building stuff, zapping my hands, and forgetting to turn off the soldering iron.
