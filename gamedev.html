<h3 class="tag-blurb">I've been programming, playing, and studying games since I was young 
    and hope to publish a game in the near future. 
    I haven't rolled anything out since my freshman year of college (2015), 
    but I still enjoy exploring mechanics and fun possibilities through protoyping in Unity.</h3>
