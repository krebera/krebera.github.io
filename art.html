<h3 class="tag-blurb">I used to art really hard when I was in highschool. I just got an iPad Pro and will probably end up messing around in ProCreate. Those brushes are too shiny to resist. Other than that, I do some 3D artwork and character design when I have the time. We will see if any posts end up living here.
