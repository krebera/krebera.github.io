For my upcoming ArtsEngine Microgrant project, I’ve been featured on the Electrical and Computer Engineering website. I’ll be attaching a sensor array to the ‘Cube’ (Alamo) statue on campus. Using some physics and the parallel axis theorem I’ll be doing my best to compute realtime velocities. Hopefully the pi-zero can keep up.

Here’s the link to the [full article](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2017/students-digital-art-makes-the-cube-even-more-interactive.html).

Here’s a small preview:

>CE junior Keenan Rebera wants to make the Michigan Union’s famous Cube sculpture even more interesting  with the power of technology. The spinning metal art installation nestled on central campus draws a lot of curious eyes, but Rebera thinks he can take the experience to the next level.

>Rebera has designed a small sensor array and display device that attaches magnetically to the Cube. When active, it can detect the velocity of the Cube when a person spins it and generate any number of fun factoids to show off. How fast did you just spin this thing? How many times has it been spun today? If The Cube were a generator, how much power would it be producing right now?
