The Avengers are sweeping across theaters everywhere these days, and ever since Iron Man came out, I knew who I wanted to be. JARVIS, Tony Stark's personal assistant, keeps everything running smoothly for him. He responds to audio cues, much like a Google Home, or Alexa, (Or homepod at this point). I wanted to make one of these guys and use it as a long work in progress.

I had built a GroupMe chatbot a while ago using Machine Learning, natural language analysis, and reverse naive Bayesian filtering. It was actually pretty helpful! The bot could get me bus times and calendar events, as well as respond to input in whatever fashion I desired.

I thought I'd marry this bot to the Google AIY kit, and then give the thing eyes.
Essentially I want a sassy version of Tony Stark's camera buddy. This guy:
(I think his name is DUMB_E?)

Anyways, the cardboard kit that came with AIY just wasn't good enough, so I thought I'd print my own enclosure.

I decided on the name "Ava" for Autonomous Vocal Assistant. Clean and catchy.

### Design Time
Used the Concepts app again to gather measurements, take notes, and draft ideas.

Once I settled on something I moved into Fusion 360:

### Fabrication
I actually printed these pieces at the local library!

I got everything done but the body. They emailed me all in a tizzy that it was 'giving them problems' and I didn't understand what they meant. Then they sent me this picture:

So Idk what I'm gonna do about that. Once I have the enclosure complete, though, I'll get to work giving it a personality and skillset.

I definitely think an annoying alarm clock would be great, or for the bot to tell me when the bus is getting close, among other things.
More to come!
