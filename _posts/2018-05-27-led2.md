##It's Alive!
I finally got the whole rainbow to work!
I ended up using an ATTINY85, as it had the perfect number of PWM pins for the application. I'm considering upgrading to an ESP later so I can control the thing over wifi like it was originally meant to be controlled.

Firstly, the wall wart itself is 12V and the LED's will draw *way* too many amps to run the power through the attiny. My solution here was actually to rip the 5V regulator out of one of those cheap-o cigarette-outlet chargers that I found, broken, in my girlfriend's car. The regulator, however worked fine. Thank you, charger, for donating your body to science.

Then I needed two more N-Channel power MOSFETS in order to safely drive the voltage on the G and B pins independently. These came from an old, broken macbook charger:

After that, I expertly drew a little schematic to work off of. Very professional stuff.

And finally, here is the completed breaboard and a gif of the operation. Success never felt so colorful. I'll be excited to put this in my room when I switch houses in the fall!
