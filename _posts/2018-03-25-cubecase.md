Still in the enclosure design phase! I think I've printed like 6 or 7 prototypes at this point. Really struggling with warping, since I don't always get the heated buildplate on the university printers. It's first-come-first-serve there. On the bright side, the iPad Pro is great for annotating images in the design phase. Much better than a notebook.

EDIT: I've actually totally updated this enclosure design after watching more Fusion 360 videos. More to come. It's a lot, lot better now!
