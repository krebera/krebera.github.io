Used some time this weekend to get a shield ready on some protoboard for the Arduino. It connects the correct pins for In-System Programming of an Atmel attiny avr. There are circuit diagrams all over the place for building these. I wanted a permanent and quick solution for programming and reprogramming.

### Regrets, revisions, resolves:

In hindsight, a heartbeat and positive connection LED would be great for some feedback during programming. An exposed reset button extension would be great too, as time-sync errors happen all the time with the Arduino-as-ISP. Luckily, solder isnâ€™t  permanent.

### Resources:

Most of what I worked off of came from the great information over at High-Low Tech:

[Programming the ATTINY](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695)

[The circuit](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1706)
